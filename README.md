# imgen
Given a image as model, imgen generates another image by drawing random triangles, keeping the modification if it improves the likeness. It's actually a kind of genetic algorithm.

Have a look [here](http://imgen.dbarth.eu/) to see it in action.

The idea comes from [this repo](https://github.com/Amanite/ocamlpics).
